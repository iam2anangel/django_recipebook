to create a local repository on someone else's project:
.git/config change name and save to upstream
git remote add origin plus the link
run in terminal 
modifies the remote
git push origin master
now on my computer i have an upstream version and a forked version so now we need to link with github


git fork
copy path with ssh
ssh password is August17
git clone plus link 
cd into project
git pull so they can see changes need help with this though

you could create another branch and do work there
then commit to branch
git add butts
git commit -sm "touched the butt"
git checkout master and the other branch will not be there
git branch morethings
git checkout morethings
make changes
git add .
git commit
git checkout morethings

git checkout -b butts - creates a new branch and immediately checks it out
